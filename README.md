## Problem statement:
`print_iterative()` function should accept `$list` and print an html list.
See `list.php` for example list.

Implement `print_iterative()` so that:
1. It traverses the array iteratively, not recursively.
2. It accounts for `n` depth (not just like the example list) where n is an integer.
